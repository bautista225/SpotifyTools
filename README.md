## Usage
### Obtaining a Spotify Client ID
Login into Spotify Web API
In the dashboard, create a new app adding the following scope: 
```
playlist-read-private 
playlist-read-collaborative 
playlist-modify-public 
playlist-modify-private 
user-read-recently-played 
user-top-read
user-read-private
user-read-email
```
You'll retrieve your own client ID.
### Running in local
After clonning the repository, add a `.env` file with the following content:
```
VITE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR-SPOTIFY-DEVELOPER-CLIENT-ID
```
In the root directory of the repo, install the NPM packages with:
```
npm install
```
Run an instance in localhost:5173 with:
```
npm run dev
```
## Limitations
Since 2022 the Spotify API has limitations in the number of requests and the user accounts able to login through a Developer Client ID, as it needs to add the user account in the developer panel. If you want to use it by the Github Pages link, don't hesitate to ask me ðŸ˜‰
